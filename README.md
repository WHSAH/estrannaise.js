### estrannaise.js
estrannaise.js is a small playground for estradiol pharmacokinetics. It can simulate estradiol blood levels under arbitrary dosing regimes and schedules. In the near future it will allow users to infer model parameters from outside sources, including their own personal blood levels.

Under the hood, estrannaise.js uses pharmacokinetic compartments models and MCMC inference using a simple Gaussian model with mixed effects or for more complicated pooled dataset our very own homebrewed hierarchical Bayesian model called Emix.

### Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/WHSAH/estrannaise.js
cd estrannaise.js
python -m http.server 8000
```
and then direct your browser to <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.

### Changelog

### TODO
- Add visual markers for dose times
- Automatically remove double empty tailing input lines
- Offer different ways to visualize the uncertainty (parallel sigma lines and cloud ensemble of curves)
- Deal with customdose visibilities and table differently.
- Allow possibility of changing patch wear time
- Oral/sublingual/iv/gel models
- Re-organize the mess of pk/math notes
