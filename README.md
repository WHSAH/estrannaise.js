# estrannaise.js
estrannaise.js is a small playground for estradiol pharmacokinetics. It can simulate estradiol blood levels under arbitrary dosing regimes and schedules. In the near future it will allow users to infer model parameters from outside sources, including their own personal blood levels.

Under the hood, estrannaise.js uses pharmacokinetic compartments models and MCMC inference using either a flat Gaussian model or our very own homebrewed hierarchical Bayesian amodel called Emix.

**estrannaise.js is entirely client-side. Your data, whether entered, imported, or stashed, remains exclusively within your browser and will never be transmitted to the developer(s) or any third-party.**

# TODO
- Allow entering days between doses rather than since day 0
- Add possibility to change patch wear time
- Add button should default to same ester as the last entry
- Add different ways to visualize the uncertainty (parallel sigma lines and cloud ensemble of curves)
- Handle mixed days/dates. If one or more dates are present in the day column days assume offsets are in relation to the earliest date
- Add sublingual/buccal model (2C model?)
- Add oral model (4C compartment with combined E1+E1S C's, or 5C with separate E1 and E1S C's)
