### estrannaise.js
estrannaise.js is a small playground for estradiol pharmacokinetics. It can simulate estradiol blood levels at steady-state (repeated doses) or under an arbitrary regimen.

Under the hood, estrannaise.js uses 3-compartments pharmacokinetic models with decaying baselines which were inferred separately in Esterlabe.jl (unreleased) using MAP estimation and MCMC over a simple probabilistic model to account for uncertainty.
