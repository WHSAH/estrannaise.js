            <p class="indent">The cloud visualization does not represent individual data points; rather, it
                illustrates the uncertainty inherent in the model itself. Importantly, this visualization
                underestimates the total uncertainty, as it only captures the uncertainty associated with
                the population mean, or more accurately the uncertainty in the parameters of the deterministic
                estradiol curve. It does not account for the full distribution of outcomes across the broader
                population. This limitation is expected to be addressed in future updates by incorporating
                a more comprehensive representation of uncertainty, including population variability
                around the deterministic curve.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">Current understanding suggests that the pharmacokinetics of estradiol ester
                depots is highly variable and influenced by numerous factors that are not well understood
                or consistently accounted for in existing models of this class of drugs. These factors can
                lead to significantly divergent outcomes and are often poorly represented, if at all, in
                current modeling efforts. Key variables include ester concentration, the type of oil used,
                the proportion and type of excipients (e.g., benzyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol), injection
                site, injection depth, route of administration (intramuscular vs. subcutaneous), individual
                metabolic differences, lifestyles and health, and interactions with concomitant medications.
                While some of these factors may be partially captured in the model's uncertainty when data is
                abundant and derived from multiple studies under varying conditions, this is rarely the case.
                Many of these factors also apply to other routes of estradiol administration, such as transdermal,
                oral, and sublingual. Efforts are underway to improve and generalize the models to better reflect
                this variability, though their accuracy and scope will always be constrained by the availability
                and quality of the underlying data.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">All pharmacokinetic data used to infer intramuscular models have been manually
                redigitized from scratch from the original studies cited in the <a href="https://transfemscience.org/articles/injectable-e2-meta-analysis/" target="_blank">tfs meta-analysis</a>.
                Where possible, per-patient data were further segmented into individual datasets rather than
                represented by their global average. Please consult the <a href="docs/refs/">full list of references</a>
                for a comprehensive account of all data sources.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">Additionally, we employ a distinct, process-centric strategy for handling baseline 
                data. While the TFS simulator applies a global offset to force the first data point to zero 
                during preprocessing, our approach leaves the data unaltered and incorporates a decaying 
                contribution to capture baseline dynamics. This contribution is represented by a simple structure
                that transitions from a constant level before administration to a decaying exponential afterward,
                which is then combined with the full three-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Together, these 
                components form the overall estradiol curve, describing the exogenous administration of estradiol
                esters while seamlessly accounting for uncertainty in the baseline data. This approach provides 
                a more accurate representation of the elimination process and eventual suppression of endogenous 
                estradiol production, while naturally resolving the issue of negative levels that can arise with 
                global offset corrections.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">
                Note that pharmacokinetic data for estradiol enanthate (<span class="standout-text">een im</span>)
                and intramuscular estradiol undecylate (<span class="standout-text">eun im</span>) are substantially
                sparser compared to other esters. The data for estradiol enanthate comes entirely from studies
                on Perlutal from the 80s and 90s. The data for estradiol undecylate comes from only two studies
                (Vermeulen 1975 and Geppert's 1975 thesis) which both stopped measuring estradiol levels at
                the 2 week mark, thus preventing the model from capturing the full pharmacokinetic profile of the
                elimination phase and with it an accurate estimate of the terminal half-life.

            <p class="indent">The model for subcutaneous estradiol undecylate depots using castor oil
                (<span class="standout-text">eun casubq</span>) was inferred by augmenting the

                models with sparse self-reported community data (n=4). As a result, its predictions are
                associated with high uncertainty.

            <p class="indent">The once-weekly (<span class="standout-text">patch ow</span>) and
                twice-weekly (<span class="standout-text">patch tw</span>) patch models were derived from
                two studies by Houssain et al. and drug labels for Climara, Mylan, and Menostar matrix patches.
                See the list of references above. Based on insights from self-reported community data, it
                is important to note that both models significantly underestimate uncertainty, which is
                likely closer to ten times greater than currently represented. Future updates will aim to
                address this discrepancy. Additionally, the interface currently does not allow for adjustments
                to the patch wearing period (they are fixed at 3&frac12; and 7 days) though this
                functionality is planned in future updates.

            <p><strong>Note on "inappropriate WPATH regimens" presets</strong>
                <p class="indent">The WPATH Standards of Care (Appendix C, page S254) lists several hormone
                    replacement therapy (HRT) regimens for transfeminine individuals. However, some of these
                    recommendations may not align with WPATH's own guidelines and could even pose potential
                    risks. Here's a breakdown of the issues.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Issue with 5-30 mg intramuscular injections every 2 weeks:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The half-life of estradiol valerate (EV) and estradiol cypionate (EC) are approximately
                            4 and 8 days, respectively. Administering injections every two weeks necessitates higher doses,
                            leading to significant fluctuations in hormone levels. This can result in very high levels
                            shortly after the injection and very low levels before the next dose, potentially causing
                            mood swings in susceptible individuals and risking the reactivation of testosterone production in
                            the last few days leading up to the next injection.
                        </li>
                        <li>At the lower dose limit (5 mg every 2 weeks), estradiol levels may fall below the threshold
                            for monotherapy after approximately 7 days, risking the restart of testosterone production and
                            estradiol levels dropping below 100 pg/mL, which contradicts WPATH's recommended levels.
                        </li>
                        <li>At the upper dose limit (30 mg every 2 weeks), estradiol levels may spike dangerously high
                            (upwards of 2,000 pg/mL with EV and 1,000 pg/mL with EC), increasing the risk of thrombotic
                            events in predisposed individuals.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Issue with 2-10 mg intramuscular injections every week:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At the lower dose limit (2 mg weekly), estradiol levels may remain consistently around
                            100 pg/mL throughout the week with EC and below 100 pg/mL during the second half of the
                            week with EV, potentially necessitating the use of an anti-androgen to suppress testosterone
                            production or block its effects.
                        </li>
                        <li>Using the upper dose limit (10 mg every week), estradiol levels may consistently exceed
