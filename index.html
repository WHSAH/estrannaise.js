            <p class="indent">The cloud does not represent data points, it is a visual representation of the
                uncertainty in the model itself and it underestimates the total uncertainty.
                It only captures the uncertainty of something akin to a population mean, or more precisely the
                uncertainty over the parameters of the deterministic estradiol curve. It does not capture the
                full distribution of outcomes in the population at large. This is bound to change in the future
                once a better representation of this uncertainty gets implemented (which would include the
                additional population variability around the deterministic curve).
            </p>

            <p class="indent">The emerging consensus is that the pharmacokinetics of estradiol ester depots
                is highly variable and depends on many factors that are not well understood and rarely taken
                into account. Those factors can lead to vastly different outcomes and are not well represented,
                if at all, in the current models. Those include, among others, the ester concentration, the
                type of oil used, the proportion and type of excipients such as benzyl benzoate that are present
                in the formulation, the injection site, whether the depot is injected intramuscularly or
                subcutaneously, the injection depth, individual differences in metabolism, and the presence
                of other drugs. Some of those confounding factors are sometimes captured to an extent in the
                uncertainty of the models, but only when the data is abundant and spans multiple studies done
                under different conditions. This is, of course, generally not the case. Several of those factors
                also apply to transdermal, oral, and sublingual estradiol. I am actively working to improve and
                generalize the current models in ways that will better capture this variability, but ultimately
                their accuracy and scope will always be limited by the data available.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">All pharmacokinetic data used to infer intramuscular models has been redigitized 
                from scratch from the original studies mentioned in the <a href="https://transfemscience.org/articles/injectable-e2-meta-analysis/" target="_blank">tfs meta-analysis</a>.
                We further split per-patient data into individual datasets when possible.
                See the <a href="docs/refs/">full list of references</a> for more information.
                Note that pharmacokinetic data for estradiol enanthate (<span class="standout-text">een im</span>)
                and estradiol undecylate (<span class="standout-text">eun im</span>) is substantially sparser
                than for other esters. The data for estradiol enanthate comes entirely from studies on Perlutal
                from the 80s and 90s. The data for estradiol undecylate comes from two studies (Vermeulen 1975 and the 1975 
                thesis of Geppert) which both stopped measuring estradiol levels at the 2 week mark, thus preventing
                the model from capturing the full pharmacokinetic profile of the elimination phase and with it
                an accurate estimate of the terminal half-life.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">The data behind the estradiol undecylate model for subcutaneous depots using
                castor oil (<span class="standout-text">eun casubq</span>) was inferred on top of the
                <span class="standout-text">eun im</span> model by augmenting it with very sparse self-reported
                community data. Its predictions are highly uncertain.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">The once-weekly patch model (<span class="standout-text">patch ow</span>) and
                twice-weekly patch model (<span class="standout-text">patch tw</span>) were from two 
                studies by Houssain et al. and drug labels of Climara, Mylan, and Menostar drug labels.
                <a href="docs/refs/#patch_refs"> References can be found here.</a>.
                In light of knowledge gathered from self-reported community data, please be advised that
                both models excessively underestimate the uncertainty which should be close to 10 times larger.
                The models will be improved to better reflect this in the future.
                Currently there is no way to change the wearing period of the patch in the interface
                (i.e. they are fixed at 3&frac12; and 7 days) but it is planned for the future.

            <p><strong>Note regarding "inapproprite WPATH regimens" presets</strong>
                <p class="indent">In the WPATH Standards of Care (Appendix C, page S254), several hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens for transfeminine people are listed. However, some of these recommendations might not align with WPATH's own guidelines and could even be harmful. Here's a breakdown of the issues.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Problem with recommended 5-30 mg intramuscular injections every 2 weeks:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The half-life of estradiol valerate and cypionate are approximately 4 and 8 days, respectively. Injecting every 2 weeks requires higher doses and can cause large fluctuations in hormone levels, leading to very high levels shortly after the injection and very
                            low levels before the next injection. This can cause mood swings and potentially restart testosterone production in the last few days before the next injection.</li>
                        <li>Using the lower dose limit (5 mg every 2 weeks), hormone levels may drop too low for monotherapy after about 7 days, potentially allowing testosterone production to restart, and further down below 100 pg/mL at odds with WPATH's own recommended levels.</li>
                        <li>Using the upper dose limit (30 mg every 2 weeks), hormone levels could spike dangerously high (upwards of 2,000 pg/mL with EV and 1,000 pg/mL with EC), increasing the risk of blood clots for those predisposed to thrombotic events.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem with recommended 2 to 10 mg intramuscular injections every week:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using the lower dose limit (2 mg every week), hormone levels may consistently stay below 150 pg/mL throughout the week with EC and during the second half of the week with EV, and below 100 pg/mL in the last 2 days of the week for both, which might necessitate using an anti-androgen to suppress testosterone.</li>
                        <li>Using the upper dose limit (10 mg every week), hormone levels may consistently stay above 300-400 pg/mL, which is much higher than WPATH’s own recommended levels.</li>
                    </ul>
