            <p class="indent">The cloud does not represent data points, it is a visual representation of the
                uncertainty in the model itself and it underestimates the total uncertainty.
                It only captures the uncertainty of something akin to a population mean, or more precisely the
                uncertainty over the parameters of the deterministic estradiol curve. It does not capture the
                full distribution of outcomes in the population at large. This is bound to change in the future
                once a better representation of this uncertainty gets implemented (which would include the
                additional population variability around the deterministic curve).
            </p>

            <p class="indent">The emerging consensus is that the pharmacokinetics of estradiol ester depots
                is highly variable and depends on many factors that are not well understood and rarely taken
                into account. Those factors can lead to vastly different outcomes and are not well represented,
                if at all, in the current models. Those include, among others, the ester concentration, the
                type of oil used, the proportion and type of excipients such as benzyl benzoate that are present
                in the formulation, the injection site, whether the depot is injected intramuscularly or
                subcutaneously, the injection depth, individual differences in metabolism, and the presence
                of other drugs. Some of those confounding factors are sometimes captured to an extent in the
                uncertainty of the models, but only when the data is abundant and spans multiple studies done
                under different conditions. This is, of course, generally not the case. Several of those factors
                also apply to transdermal, oral, and sublingual estradiol. I am actively working to improve and
                generalize the current models in ways that will better capture this variability, but ultimately
                their accuracy and scope will always be limited by the data available.

            <p class="indent">All data for estradiol benzoate, valerate, enanthate, and cypionate intramuscular depot models

                has been digitized from scratch from the original studies mentioned in the
                <a href="https://transfemscience.org/articles/injectable-e2-meta-analysis/" target="_blank">tfs meta-analysis</a>.
                Data was further reprocessed by splitting per-patient data into individual datasets when possible, and
                by using the uncertainty reported in the studies. Note that the data for estradiol enanthate is unusually
                sparse and comes entirely from studies of Perlutan from the 80s and 90s. Perlutan is a long-acting
                injectable contraceptive contraining DHPA + EEn in sunflower oil.

                This data is extremely sparse and incomplete and thus the model is highly uncertain.

                community data. Its predictions are also highly uncertain.

            <p class="indent">The once-weekly patch model (<span class="standout-text">patch ow</span>) was
                inferred using data found in drug labels of once-weekly Climara and Menostar patches.
                The twice-weekly patch model (<span class="standout-text">patch tw</span>) was inferred
                using data taken from two 2003 studies by Houssain et al. looking at twice-weekly Estradot
                and Menorest patches, and in the drug label of twice-weekly Mylan patches.
                In light of knowledge gathered from self-reported community data, please be advised that
                both models excessively underestimate the uncertainty which should be close to 10 times larger.
                The models will be improved to better reflect this in the future.
                Currently there is no way to change the wearing period of the patch in the interface
                (i.e. they are fixed at 3&frac12; and 7 days) but it is planned for the future.

            <p><strong>Note regarding "inapproprite WPATH regimens" presets</strong>
                <p class="indent">In the WPATH Standards of Care (Appendix C, page S254), several hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens for transfeminine people are listed. However, some of these recommendations might not align with WPATH's own guidelines and could even be harmful. Here's a breakdown of the issues.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Problem with recommended 5-30 mg intramuscular injections every 2 weeks:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The half-life of estradiol valerate and cypionate are approximately 4 and 8 days, respectively. Injecting every 2 weeks requires higher doses and can cause large fluctuations in hormone levels, leading to very high levels shortly after the injection and very
                            low levels before the next injection. This can cause mood swings and potentially restart testosterone production in the last few days before the next injection.</li>
                        <li>Using the lower dose limit (5 mg every 2 weeks), hormone levels may drop too low for monotherapy after about 7 days, potentially allowing testosterone production to restart, and further down below 100 pg/mL at odds with WPATH's own recommended levels.</li>
                        <li>Using the upper dose limit (30 mg every 2 weeks), hormone levels could spike dangerously high (upwards of 2,000 pg/mL with EV and 1,000 pg/mL with EC), increasing the risk of blood clots for those predisposed to thrombotic events.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem with recommended 2 to 10 mg intramuscular injections every week:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using the lower dose limit (2 mg every week), hormone levels may consistently stay below 150 pg/mL throughout the week with EC and during the second half of the week with EV, and below 100 pg/mL in the last 2 days of the week for both, which might necessitate using an anti-androgen to suppress testosterone.</li>
                        <li>Using the upper dose limit (10 mg every week), hormone levels may consistently stay above 300-400 pg/mL, which is much higher than WPATH’s own recommended levels.</li>
                    </ul>
